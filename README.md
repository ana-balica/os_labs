OS labworks
=============

What is this?
---------------

For the OS (Operating Systems) class, I as student of Technical University of Moldova Anglophone Department of Computer Science, am keeping all my laboratory work here. The repo is made available to my teacher in order to enhance my work and to evaluate the results.

How do I see all the labworks?
-------------------------------

Totally there are 6 labworks (the last 2 are united). Those are stored on braches given the template name `lab#number`. The descriptions for each lab can be found in a `.md` file called **Report**.


*To all my groupmates* - don't dare to clone my repos :D
